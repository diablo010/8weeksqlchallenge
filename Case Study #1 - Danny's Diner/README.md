## Business Task
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite.

## Creating dannys_diner database schema

````sql
create database dannys_diner;
use dannys_diner;

create table sales (
    customer_id varchar(1),
    order_date date,
    product_id int
);

create table menu (
    product_id int unique,
    product_name varchar(20),
    price int
);

create table members (
    customer_id varchar(1) unique,
    join_date date
);

insert into sales
values ('A', '2021-01-01', '1'),
  ('A', '2021-01-01', '2'),
  ('A', '2021-01-07', '2'),
  ('A', '2021-01-10', '3'),
  ('A', '2021-01-11', '3'),
  ('A', '2021-01-11', '3'),
  ('B', '2021-01-01', '2'),
  ('B', '2021-01-02', '2'),
  ('B', '2021-01-04', '1'),
  ('B', '2021-01-11', '1'),
  ('B', '2021-01-16', '3'),
  ('B', '2021-02-01', '3'),
  ('C', '2021-01-01', '3'),
  ('C', '2021-01-01', '3'),
  ('C', '2021-01-07', '3');

insert into menu
values ('1', 'sushi', '10'),
  ('2', 'curry', '15'),
  ('3', 'ramen', '12');
  
insert into members
values  ('A', '2021-01-07'),
  ('B', '2021-01-09');
 
````
Using `create table` and `insert into`, we have created the `dannys_diner` schema. It consists of Danny's 3 datasets: `sales`, `menu`, `members`.

## Question and Solution
***Note: In some questions, two solutions are listed. Out of which, first one is mine and the latter is from the [github repo](https://github.com/katiehuangx/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/tree/main) I referred. 
**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**
````sql
select customer_id, sum(price)
from sales inner join menu
on sales.product_id = menu.product_id
group by customer_id;
````
#### Answer:
| customer_id | sum(price)  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

````sql
select customer_id, count(distinct order_date) as total_visits
from sales
group by customer_id;
````
#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_visits |
| ----------- | -----------  |
| A           | 4            |
| B           | 6            |
| C           | 2            |

**3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**

````sql
select distinct customer_id, product_id, order_date
from sales
order by order_date;
````
Note: this does not give only one item.

Solution:
````sql
WITH ordered_sales AS (
  SELECT 
    sales.customer_id, 
    sales.order_date, 
    menu.product_name,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY sales.customer_id 
      ORDER BY sales.order_date) AS rank
  FROM dannys_diner.sales
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
    ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
)

SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  product_name
FROM ordered_sales
WHERE rank = 1
GROUP BY customer_id, product_name;
````

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | curry        | 
| A           | sushi        | 
| B           | curry        | 
| C           | ramen        |

**4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**
````sql
select menu.product_name, sales.product_id, count(sales.product_id) as most_frequent
from sales inner join menu
on sales.product_id = menu.product_id
group by sales.product_id
order by most_frequent desc limit 1;
````
#### Answer:
| product_name | most_purchased | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
|    ramen    | 8 |

Solution:
````sql
SELECT 
  menu.product_name,
  COUNT(sales.product_id) AS most_purchased_item
FROM dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY menu.product_name
ORDER BY most_purchased_item DESC
LIMIT 1;
````

#### Answer:
| most_purchased | product_name | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 8       | ramen |

**5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?**
````sql
select menu.product_name, sales.product_id, count(sales.product_id) as most_frequent
from sales inner join menu
on sales.product_id = menu.product_id
where customer_id = 'A'
group by sales.product_id
order by most_frequent desc limit 1;
````
#### Answer:
| product_name | product_id | most_frequent |
| ----------- | ---------- |------------  |
| curry       | 2          |  2           |


It gives result by changing value in `where` clause but does not consider same count like in B where all items are purchased equally.

Solution:
````sql
WITH most_popular AS (
  SELECT 
    sales.customer_id, 
    menu.product_name, 
    COUNT(menu.product_id) AS order_count,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY sales.customer_id 
      ORDER BY COUNT(sales.customer_id) DESC) AS rank_
  FROM dannys_diner.menu
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.sales
    ON menu.product_id = sales.product_id
  GROUP BY sales.customer_id, menu.product_name
)

SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  product_name, 
  order_count
FROM most_popular 
WHERE rank_ = 1;
````
#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name | order_count |
| ----------- | ---------- |------------  |
| A           | ramen        |  3   |
| B           | sushi        |  2   |
| B           | curry        |  2   |
| B           | ramen        |  2   |
| C           | ramen        |  3   |
*Each user may have more than 1 favourite item.*
