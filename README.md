# 8 Week SQL Challenge – with MySQL & PostgreSQL flavor

Welcome to my personal repository for the **8 Week SQL Challenge**!  
This project documents my SQL journey, solutions, and insights while solving each case study — starting with MySQL and later expanding into PostgreSQL for further case studies.

## What is the 8 Week SQL Challenge?

The [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) is a free, open SQL learning project created by **Danny Ma**.  
It offers 8 real-world inspired case studies to sharpen your SQL skills by solving analytical problems using actual business-like data. Each case study focuses on a unique domain — from food and marketing to banking and retail analytics.
