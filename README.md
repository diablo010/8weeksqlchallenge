# 8 Week SQL Challenge – with MySQL & PostgreSQL flavor

Welcome to my personal repository for the **8 Week SQL Challenge**!  
This project documents my SQL journey, solutions, and insights while solving each case study — starting with MySQL and later expanding into PostgreSQL for further case studies.

## What is the 8 Week SQL Challenge?
