### 2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?

````sql
select r.runner_id, avg(timestampdiff(minute, c.order_time, r.pickup_time)) as avg_time_taken
from customer_orders_temp c
left join runner_orders_temp r
on c.order_id = r.order_id
where r.distance is not null
group by r.runner_id;
````

### 3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?

````sql
with prep_time_cte as (
	select c.order_id,
		count(c.order_id) as pizza_order, 
		timestampdiff(minute, min(c.order_time), max(r.pickup_time)) as prep_time
	-- full-group-by prevents due to ordertime and pickuptime
    -- so min max are used
    -- since there is only one value, it gives same value
    from customer_orders_temp c
	left join runner_orders_temp r
	on c.order_id = r.order_id
	where r.distance is not null
	group by c.order_id   -- group by cannot happen on aggregated functions
)

select pizza_order,
       avg(prep_time) as avg_prep_time
from prep_time_cte
group by pizza_order;
````

### 4. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?

````sql
select c.customer_id, 
	   round(avg(r.distance), 2) as avg_distance
from customer_orders_temp c
left join runner_orders_temp r
on c.order_id = r.order_id
where r.distance is not null
group by c.customer_id;

### 5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?

from runner_orders_temp r;
````

### 6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?

````sql
select r.runner_id, 
	   r.order_id, 
       r.distance / r.duration * 60 as speed
from runner_orders_temp r
where r.distance is not null
order by r.runner_id, speed;
````

### 7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

````sql
select r.runner_id, 
        100 * sum(
    		case when r.distance is null then 0
                    else 1 end) / count(*) as success_percentage
                    -- if distance is null, then takes 0 value
                    -- or takes 1 for calculation
                    -- count(*) counts null and non-null values
from runner_orders_temp r
group by r.runner_id;
````
